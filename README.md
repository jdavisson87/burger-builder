# Burger Builder

This is a project that I created while learning from "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)", taught by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

## Installation

Go to https://github.com/jdavisson87/burger-builder and clone or download all of the files for this application.

Once you have the necessary files, you will need to go to firebase.google.com and create a free account. Once created, go to your console and create a project, go to settings, and copy your Web API Key. In the root folder, create a .env file, and inside of it, create the variable REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY. The inside of the .env file should look like the following, except insert your own personal API key:

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY={Insert your Web API Key here}

After creating your .env file, open your terminal and navigate to the root folder of the downloaded repository. Then, run command:

yarn install

after you run the install, run the command:

yarn start

and the application should pull up in your web browser.
